Molex SL footprint peg holes are wrong
R6 / R7 silkscreen swapped
dimm pegs could be tighter
D1 wrong pinout
SL != C-grid, don't have SL crimper
label phases on current sensors
Standoffs wrong height

Lower voltage filter pole ~300 Hz
Snubber across bus?

Protect 5V rail from transients on 15V


didn't order u1

Ifb very dirty in general, need to bring sensors closer, add diff amp, try using Rds(on)

When doing own gate drive board - ensure minimal capacitance across isolated power domains (particularly high side)

Vds feedback fails badly during regen (conduction through D2..4 and U3..5 clamping diodes),
possibly also responsible for some of the EMI.  Delete Vds FB or use series resistance to limit current flow.
Similarly, gate drive board doesn't provide desaturation protection during regeneration.

Hardware OVP would be nice
