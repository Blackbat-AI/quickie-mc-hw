Board fabrication notes:

6 layers FR-4
Board dimensions 5.34 x 4.78 inches
Finished thickness 92 mils +/- 10%
2 oz copper on outer layers, 7 mil trace / space
3 oz copper on inner layers, 9 mil trace / space
Dielectric thickness between layers 2-3, 3-4 and 4-5:
 4.5 mils min, 6.5 mils max
Dielectric thickness between layers 1-2, 5-6:
 Approx 27 mils, adjust as needed for finished thickness

J4, J5, J6, J8, J9, J11, J12 need plated, routed slots to fit
0.146 x 0.344 inch rectangular foot for component B6A-PCB:

A routing bit diameter 0.020" or smaller should be used.
See the F.Fab layer for a rectangular outline that can be used to
generate the tool path - the finished edge of the slot should be coincident
with that rectange.  0.020" drilled holes provide relief in the corners.
The 0.145" central drilled hole may be used to start the router cut, or
omitted.

I1, I2, I3 also need plated, routed slots; these are described by the "oval"
pad type in KiCad.  They are to fit the PFF leadform, see page 27 of
www.allegromicro.com/~/media/Files/Datasheets/ACS770-Datasheet.ashx

Assembly notes:

B6A-PCB orderable from https://lugsdirect.com/B6A-PCB-HEX.htm or we can furnish.
I1, I2, I3, T1 should be installed on board underside.
