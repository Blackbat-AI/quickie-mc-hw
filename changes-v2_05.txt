Mechanical:
* Moved C36 away from transformer for physical clearance

Sensing Performance:
* C133-135 Added 1uF bulk capacitance to Hall sensors
* U21-U23 + Caps Added to create psuedo diff input
* Moved R26,40,44 + R32,33,34,35 near to uC so filter is functional
** I know this gain/divide could be done in opamp not res divider, but this is low risk path
** I did not create net-tie for GND so there are explicit cutouts under Via so planes don't create local short to GND
* New layer stackup, In1-In4 Analog Grounds, In3 Analog Supply, In 2 Current sense signals
* Small amount of stitching, didn't make good use of the layers trying to keep HV sense widely spaced
* Moved 1v8 Digital Rail to East of uC
* Moved Analog supply ties to between Current and Voltage sense.
** Maybe not a good place for 3v3 reg.

JTAG:
* TRST is now pulldown so we boot from Flash

Safety:
* Still not very safe
* C61,C62 Swapped Y caps for THT Y1 parts
* R53,R57 Added extra footprint in resistor divider path 
* TH1,TH2 Removed, encouraged board to flash over. Unused anyway

Misc:
* Removed Aux ADC connector
* Removed Novelty sized test points on sense signals
* MELFs: Build with 15R


Outstanding Issues:
* F1, Fuse should be removed from return path
* U11 still needs suitable replacement
* Many skinny traces used in current paths
