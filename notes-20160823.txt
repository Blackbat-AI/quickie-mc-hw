PSU: 60V 10A
RPM: 400
Torque ~1.15 Nm

HAL_PWM_DB*ED_CNT = 13:
Current ringing approx 2A pk-pk
phase-phase voltage @ motor ~180% of switch

HAL_PWM_DB*ED_CNT = 25:
similar


Smaller PWM series resistor?
Viper26 startup current through switch?
easy disconnect for HV->5V
footprint for LPF cap near current sensors
