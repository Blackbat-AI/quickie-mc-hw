** V2.0 bringup notes and errata: **

~PWR_RESET pulldown R54 insufficient - system will attempt to turn on all switches at powerup. 
Replace with 1k and have software ensure PWM outputs are low before raising ~PWR_RESET.

Fault LED indicates not-fault.

VIPER26 aux supply unstable.  Add 1K resistor in series with D6.

D5 reverse voltage rating marginal.  Replace with PMEG6045 or similar.

Tempo populated D34 backwards on some boards


Above issues fixed in V2.1.


Add polyfuse in series with +5VD output to thrust ctrl lever to prevent short in that harness from taking down board.
Something dies horribly when system tries to spin motor with HV only connected through precharge resistor.
Add TVS on 5V rail
Larger vias for 5V supplies to gate drive? (320 mA).  Also from Viper.  Actually maybe they're fine.
Convenient connector for 5V.
Better voltage reference?
Precision resistor for R48
Just delete the 22R resistor, inductor and fuse between HV and Viper input.
Shield the cable to the Emrax thermistor
tRST should have pull-down not pull-up to boot standalone
