** V2.0 bringup notes and errata: **

~PWR_RESET pulldown R54 insufficient - system will attempt to turn on all switches at powerup. 
Replace with 1k and have software ensure PWM outputs are low before raising ~PWR_RESET.

Fault LED indicates not-fault.

VIPER26 aux supply unstable.  Add 1K resistor in series with D6.

D5 reverse voltage rating marginal.  Replace with PMEG6045 or similar.

Tempo populated D34 backwards on some boards


Above issues fixed in V2.1.
